# Concatalyst
By Kontonkitsune
Version Alpha 0.19 (Last updated November 27th, 2023)
Concatalyst is an action-puzzle game designed around making very long chains of connected colors, and then detonating them with catalysts!

You can use rainbow squares to connect two different colors together to create chains lasting multiple colors!

# Installation

Download the zip file for the most recent version, extract it, then run Concatalyst-vXX.exe. The Concatalyst-vXX.py file will also run the game if you have a python interpreter and the pygame library installed.

The game should run fine, so long as the game is in the same directory as the concatalystlogo.png file.

You can change the game's background by putting an image file called "BackgroundImage.jpg" in the game's directory.

# Controls

Most control schemes are supported, but you cannot change them from the base controls the game has.

WASD / Arrow Keys / numpad arrow keys work for directional input,

ENTER / Z / E / numpadenter all work for CONFIRM / Rotate clockwise

BACKSPACE / X / Q work as CANCEL / Rotate Counterclockwise

ESCAPE does pretty much what is expected, it pauses the game.
